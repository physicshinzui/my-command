## ssync (based on rsync)
Options of the rsync command are selected carefully, enabling us to execute the rsync safely.

### Usage:
`ssync [original file/dir] [target file/dir]`

### Outline of my script
1. Dry-run is executed to confirm your backup is done correctly.
2. Vim comes, showing you the log file generated by the dry-run. After checking, close it.
3. Terminal asks you if you wana go on or not. If ok, enter.
4. Backup is started.

### Important notes
`-b` and `â€“-backup-dir=[target path]` are active, 
so even though `--delete` option removes the files that do not exist in the original directory but in the target one, 
the files are saved to `[target path]`.

### Active options
- `--delete` is active, so the files in target directory that are not in the original are removed.
- `--dry-run` is active and its log is shown. So you can check if you can go on to syncing.
- `-a` is active for archive
- `-z` is active for complession

## watch (Emulator of the linux watch command)
### Usage:
